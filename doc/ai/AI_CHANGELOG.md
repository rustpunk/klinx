# AI Changelog

## Purpose

This file is lightweight architecture/change memory for future agents. It should record durable facts, major changes, and resolved uncertainty. Do not invent past decisions.

## 2026-06-15: Initial AI Onboarding Documentation

### Major Architecture Facts Discovered

- Klinx is a Rust 2024 workspace with two members: `crates/klinx` and `crates/klinx-git`.
- `crates/klinx` is a Dioxus 0.7 desktop IDE binary for Clinker YAML pipeline authoring.
- `crates/klinx-git` is a CLI-backed git abstraction crate with a `GitOps` trait; `gix_backend.rs` does not currently use gitoxide.
- Current Clinker engine crates are git-pinned in root `Cargo.toml` to rev `997ea7d`.
- `AppShell` owns Dioxus signals; inactive tabs store plain snapshots.
- YAML text is authoritative; node-preserving patching exists to avoid losing user-authored YAML and `nodes:`.
- The CI gauntlet uses fmt, two clippy passes, workspace tests, cargo deny, and Dioxus desktop build.
- There is no documented automated browser UI test target for the desktop webview.

### Major Unresolved Questions

- README dependency prose appears stale versus current `Cargo.toml`.
- Git status watcher refresh may not be fully wired into Dioxus state.
- Some UI pages/actions appear placeholder-like or partially wired.
- The future of the `gix_backend.rs` naming/backend plan is not fully resolved.
- Automated UI validation beyond manual/headless screenshot capture is undecided.

### Update Instructions

When architecture changes, append a dated entry with:

- What changed.
- Files/modules affected.
- Verification commands run.
- Any rules in `30_DESIGN_RULES.md` or local `AGENTS.md` that changed.
- Open questions resolved or newly discovered.
